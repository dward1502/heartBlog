# heartBlog
Website that has a bi-weekly blog filled out by myself (Daniel Ward) discussing my adventure with having a heart transplant. Also will include a page where users who create an account and login can submit their own story of transplant to a story page! Eventually will add a page for detailed information for my transplant application made with React Native
